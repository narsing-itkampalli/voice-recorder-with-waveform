# Voice Recorder with Waveform

This repository contains a **Voice Recorder with Waveform** implemented in three different ways:

- **React.js** (`react-js/`): Built using React with reusable components and state management.
- **ByteCraft** (`bytecraft/`): Implemented using the ByteCraft framework for a modular and dynamic experience.
- **Vanilla JavaScript** (`vanilla-js/`): Developed with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring lightweight performance.

> **Note:** Currently, only the **React.js** implementation is available. The **ByteCraft** and **Vanilla JavaScript** versions are in progress and will be added soon.
